# summarAize
Welcome to the world of AI! This is a fun little project created to experiment with OpenAI api. 
This application simply takes in a url of any article and summarizes it for you. 
Once the url is entered, please give the AI a minute to load the summary. The duration will vary depending on the length of the article.
Previously used urls will be saved onto local storage so the user can always look back to past summaries.
SummarAIzer is built entirely from the front-end using ReactJS, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Redux.
